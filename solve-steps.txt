I have made some notes of my thought process during this challenge. It might not make much sense to read but I will gladly walk through them during the interview if that helps.

would have first googled immediately for a solution, but decided to tackle it without
python script would have been my go-to but not very OOP and wanted to push myself a little
download text file of approved words
set up basic java app in intellij
create class for approved words
arraylist because don't need keys (dict) and uniqueness isn't essential (sets)
bug fixing
research into how to generate all possible combinations of n-length words from the n^2 input string
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29910312/algorithm-to-get-all-the-combinations-of-size-n-from-an-array-java explains we can get combinations of the indices of the array rather than the array item, I found a library earlier that does combinations of numbers from 0 so this sounds good
realised although I have my combinations I still don't have my permutations as I need all possible orders of the indices too; answers online point to recursion
some more processing to break work down into classes
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4240080/generating-all-permutations-of-a-given-string permutations of a string, so I can convert index combos back into strings then calculate permutations
The permutations will be added to a set not a list as we don't want duplicates
Just for fun and because I learned them recently I'm going to use streams to compare the set against the wordlist and modify
can use Ccombinations api again to form nCr collections of n from the valid words. Streams could be useful here too
note: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29028980/why-cant-i-map-integers-to-strings-when-streaming-from-an-array this told me i need to mapToObj to convert Stream type properly (converting indexcombo to wordcombo)
once implemented a lot of debugging e.g. point to the getPermutationsSet
realized the method is flawed - commenting it all out. successes are being generated that do not form word squares.......
some debugging during new method involved issues with strongly typed things, need more practice with this
realized issues with using hashmap for the square; difficulty in creating deep copies. Hashmap is redundant anyway as the keys are 0 1 2 3 etc... will convert to List
It's finally working so I'm going to ensure it runs from command line and make up some instructions
i need to work on multithreading: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/268593/asynchronous-and-recursive-word-square-generator-in-c
